# MSc_Shipping_2023
Project looking at impact of IMO regulations on sulphur on climate

Inspired from a recent couple of studies on impact of shipping on cloud brightening and recent intense warming of North Atlantic we are looking with an MSc student at linkages between shipping and climate change.

Data:

- CERES data from https://ceres-tool.larc.nasa.gov/ord-tool/srbavg
- ICOADS shipping data from https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/international-comprehensive-ocean-atmosphere/v3/archive/nrt/ICOADS_R3.0.0_1891-01.nc


Code:

- CERES_SSF.ipynb to load, calculate and display albedo and cloud fractions

- PlotShippingData_new.ipynb to display and track location of ships on a map

Analysis: 

- code to find linkages between track location and local climatic variables of interest (albedo, cloud, radiative balance) and to (guest)estimate global impact on our climate
